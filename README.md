<p>As an experienced Senior Software Engineer and Technical Lead, I bring a diverse background spanning both enterprise-scale and small company environments. I began my career as a web developer, but over the years, my focus has shifted towards building innovative solutions within live streaming technologies. </p>
<p>My expertise lies in leveraging full-stack development and cloud services to build and optimize video streaming solutions. I have deep experience with WebRTC, HLS, AWS Media Elemental, CDN integration, and video player technologies, all of which have enabled me to create high-performance, reliable streaming platforms.</p>
<p>In recent years, my career trajectory has taken an exciting turn toward AI technologies. I am actively seeking opportunities to combine my in-depth knowledge of live streaming with AI solutions, aiming to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in areas such as real-time analytics, video processing, and personalized content delivery.</p>
